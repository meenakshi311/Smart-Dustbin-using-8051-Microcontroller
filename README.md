# Smart-Dustbin-using-8051-Microcontroller
# Aim
Todayâ€™s world scenario of cleanliness in terms of garbage management is deteriorating
dramatically as the population grows. There are many public spots in the city where garbage
cans or overflowing dustbins can be observed.To prevent such a disaster, "Smart
Dustbin," a GSM-based Garbage and Waste Collection Bins Overflow Indicator System for
Smart Cities was developed.

# Working 
This project will send an SMS to the relevant local authorities with information on the
overflown trash can. When somebody approaches the dustbin, the lid will be opened automatically. LEDs
that indicate whether if the dustbin is full or not, here Red LED indicating FULL and Green
LED indicating EMPTY.
When the waste within the dustbin reaches around 90%, the Red LED will turn on until it is
empty again. The lid will not open again until the dustbin is empty, preventing anyone from
throwing waste into it and causing a mess.

# Results
GSM sends real time message alert to registered municipal authorities to intimate details about the garbage level.
